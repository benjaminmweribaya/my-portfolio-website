            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi there! I'm Benjamin Mweri Baya a Full-Stack Software Developer and a Chemical and Process Engineer, my passion for solving complex problems has naturally extended into
                the world of software development. Engineering, at its core, is about optimization, efficiency, and
                innovationâ€”skills that translate seamlessly into the tech industry. I believe that the fusion of
                engineering principles and coding can create transformative solutions, not only in chemical processes
                but across industries.
